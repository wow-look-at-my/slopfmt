// Package busypoll refuses a turn that is the latest in a run of several
// turns making the exact same tool call, closely spaced in time, with nothing
// else different in between. It also refuses the status read itself, before
// it runs, when nothing it could return has changed.
//
// That shape is what a manual polling loop looks like: re-running the
// same status check every turn instead of waiting for a real event or arming
// an actual scheduled wakeup. It burns the user's tokens for no new
// information, because the answer cannot have changed between calls seconds
// apart.
//
// A properly spaced watch loop -- the same check re-run after a real gap,
// because a scheduled trigger fired or an event arrived -- is not that
// pattern and is not refused. See detect.go for the spacing rule that tells
// them apart.
//
// A refusal that says "wait for the event" needs events to exist, so both
// rules that say it run in a remote session only. See environment.go.
//
// Every failure path allows. A guard that blocks because it could not read a
// file is worse than no guard.

	`Stop. The last {{.N}} turns in a row made the exact same call, with nothing else
different in between and no real wait between them -- that is a busy-poll loop,
and it burns the user's tokens for zero new signal, because the answer cannot
have changed in the seconds since the last check:

{{range .Calls}}  {{.}}
{{end}}
Do not run any of the calls above again on a hunch. Either:

  - Reply with NO tool call at all and wait for a real signal -- a queued
    notification, a scheduled trigger firing, an actual event arriving -- or
  - Arm a real wakeup with a genuine delay, using whatever this session
    actually has, then stop. Never re-check by hand in the meantime. Do not
    reach for a scheduling tool that is not in your tool list: an ordinary web
    session has none, and there ending the turn IS how you wait.

Rewrite this turn so it makes none of the calls listed above, then stop.{{if .Repeat}}

This is not the first refusal. Making the same call again will refuse again --
the fix is to stop calling it, not to call it one more time.{{end}}`))
